# Contribute to the XCM SDK

## Get Started

To contribute to the XCM SDK, you'll first need to clone the GitHub repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:moonbeam-foundation/xcm-sdk.git
```

Then, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Add an Asset

The first step in adding support for a new asset is to define the asset in the [assets configuration file](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/xcm-sdk/blob/main/packages/config/src/assets.ts){target=\_blank}. At this stage, assets are not bound to any chain, you are only creating a representation of the asset.

Follow these steps:

1. Open the `xcm-sdk/packages/config/src/assets.ts` file
2. Create a new variable for your asset. You'll need to create an [Asset Object](/core-interfaces#the-asset-object), providing the `key` and `originSymbol` of the asset

    ```ts
    export const INSERT_ASSET_NAME = new Asset({
      key: 'INSERT_KEY',
      originSymbol: 'INSERT_ORIGIN_SYMBOL',
    });
    ```

    For example, this is the configuration used for USDT:

    ```ts
    export const usdt = new Asset({
      key: 'usdt',
      originSymbol: 'USDT',
    });
    ```

3. Add your asset to the `assetsList` array at the end of the file

!!! note
    Assets are listed in alphabetical order. Please make sure you follow this order when adding new assets.

## Add a Chain

The next step to support an asset integration is to add chain information for the chains in which your asset can be sent to and from to the [chains configuration file](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/xcm-sdk/blob/main/packages/config/src/chains.ts){target=\_blank}.

To add a chain, take the following steps:

1. Open the `xcm-sdk/packages/config/src/chains.ts` file
2. Add your asset to the list of imported assets from the assets configuration file (`./assets.ts`)
3. Create a new variable for each chain, if an entry doesn't already exist. You'll need to create a [Chain Object](/core-interfaces#the-chain-object), providing metadata related to the chain

    === "Parachain"

        ```ts
        new Parachain({
          assetsData: [], // Optional - In the next step, you'll add assets here
          ecosystem: Ecosystem.INSERT_ECOSYSTEM_TYPE, // Optional
          genesisHash: 'INSERT_GENESIS_HASH',
          isTestChain: INSERT_BOOLEAN, // Optional
          key: 'INSERT_KEY',
          name: 'INSERT_NAME',
          parachainId: INSERT_PARACHAIN_ID,
          ss58Format: INSERT_SS58_FORMAT,
          usesChainDecimals: INSERT_BOOLEAN, // Optional
          ws: 'INSERT_WSS_ENDPOINT',
        })
        ```

    === "EVM Parachain"

        ```ts
        new EvmParachain({
          assetsData: [], // Optional - In the next step, you'll add assets here
          ecosystem: Ecosystem.INSERT_ECOSYSTEM_TYPE, // Optional
          genesisHash: 'INSERT_GENESIS_HASH',
          id: INSERT_EVM_CHAIN_ID,
          isTestChain: INSERT_BOOLEAN, // Optional
          key: 'INSERT_KEY',
          name: 'INSERT_NAME',
          nativeCurrency: {
            decimals: INSERT_ASSET_DECIMALS,
            name: 'INSERT_ASSET_NAME',
            symbol: 'INSERT_ASSET_SYMBOL',
          },
          parachainId: INSERT_PARACHAIN_ID,
          rpc: 'INSERT_RPC_ENDPOINT',
          ss58Format: INSERT_SS58_FORMAT,
          usesChainDecimals: INSERT_BOOLEAN, // Optional
          ws: 'INSERT_WSS_ENDPOINT',
        })
        ```

    For example, this is the configuration for the Polkadot Asset Hub:

    ```ts
    export const polkadotAssetHub = new Parachain({
      assetsData: [ ... ],
      ecosystem: Ecosystem.Polkadot,
      genesisHash:
        '0x68d56f15f85d3136970ec16946040bc1752654e906147f7e43e9d539d7c3de2f',
      key: 'Polkadot-asset-hub',
      name: 'Polkadot Asset Hub',
      parachainId: 1000,
      ss58Format: 42,
      ws: 'wss://polkadot-asset-hub-rpc.polkadot.io',
    });
    ```

4. Add the newly created chain to the `chainsList` array at the end of the file

!!! note
    Chains are listed in alphabetical order. Please make sure you follow this order when adding new chains.

Now that you've added the chain, you can continue on to the next section to add the assets that this chain supports.

## Configure a Chain's Assets

To designate a chain as a destination or source chain for an asset, you must specify the asset within the `assetsData` array of the chain's configuration. This array outlines the supported assets on the chain, and the asset information within it determines how the asset is identified or targeted on that specific chain. For example, when adding a chain's native asset, you'll need to define how the chain sees it's own asset and when adding the asset to a destination chain, you'll need to define how the destination chain sees the asset.

To enable an asset to move between chains, follow these steps to configure the source and destination chain's of an asset:

1. In the `assetsData` array of the source chain, you'll need to create a [Chain Asset Data Object](/core-interfaces#the-chain-assets-data-object) for the asset, specifying how the asset is seen on that chain

    ```ts
    {
      asset: INSERT_IMPORTED_ASSET, // The asset created in the previous section
      balanceId: INSERT_CHAIN_ASSET_ID, // (Optional) The balance ID of the asset
      decimals: INSERT_ASSET_DECIMALS // (Optional) The decimals of the asset
      id: INSERT_CHAIN_ASSET_ID, // (Optional) Location of the asset on the chain. Different for every chain
      metadata: INSERT_CHAIN_ASSET_ID // (Optional) The metadata of the asset
      min: INSERT_MIN // (Optional) The minimum amount of the asset that is required to be left in the account
      minId: INSERT_CHAIN_ASSET_ID // (Optional) The minimum ID of the asset
      palletInstance: INSERT_PALLET_INSTANCE // (Optional) The pallet instance the asset belongs to
    }
    ```

    For example, this is the configuration for USDT on the Polkadot Asset Hub:

    ```ts
    export const polkadotAssetHub = new Parachain({
      assetsData: [
        {
          asset: usdt,
          id: 1984, // The asset ID for USDT
          palletInstance: 50, // The index of the Assets pallet (where USDT lives)
        },
      ],
      ...
    });
    ```

2. In the destination chain's `assetsData` array, create a [Chain Asset Data Object](/core-interfaces#the-chain-assets-data-object) that define the asset as seen on the destination chain. This will be different than the source chain's configurations, as every chain manages assets differently

    For example, to add support for USDT on Moonbeam, Moonbeam's chain configuration needs to include the configuration for USDT:

    ```ts
    export const moonbeam = new EvmParachain({
      assetsData: [
        ...
        {
          asset: usdt,
          id: '311091173110107856861649819128533077277', // The asset ID of USDT on Moonbeam
        },
        ...
      ]
      ...
    });
    ```

The integration isn't complete yet, you'll need to define the methods that are used for cross-chain transfers for any new chains added. This will be covered in the following section.

## Configure a Chain's Extrinsics

In this step, you have to create or update the configuration files of the chains you can transfer the asset between. These files define the asset being transferred, the destination chain, information associated to fees, and builder functions. These builders define the pallets and methods necessary to achieve the specific goals of each type. They are as follows:

- **Minimum Asset Builder** - builds a query to retrieve the minimum amount of an asset required to be left in an account
- **Balance Builder** - builds a query to retrieve the balance of an asset for a given account
- **Contract Builder** - builds the contract call for the cross-chain transfer. This is specific to EVM chains that use contracts to interact with Substrate pallets for cross-chain transfers, such as [Moonbeam's X-Tokens precompiled contract](https://docs.moonbeam.network/builders/interoperability/xcm/xc20/send-xc20s/xtokens-precompile/){target=\_blank}
- **Extrinsic Builder** - builds the extrinsic for the cross-chain transfer
- **Fee Builder** - builds the query to retrieve the fee for the exeuction of the cross-chain transfer

You will need to know which pallet and method each chain is using for its XCM transactions and for fetching the assets balances, and make sure that said pallets and methods are already available in the [xcm-builder package](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/xcm-sdk/tree/main/packages/builder){target=\_blank}.

If they aren't available, feel free to open a PR or [submit a issue on GitHub](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/xcm-sdk/issues/new){target=\_blank}.

Assuming that all of the required pallets and methods are already supported, you can create the configuration file for the source chain:

1. In the `xcm-sdk/packages/config/src/configs/` directory, add a TypeScript file for the new chain
2. Use the following snippet as a starting point for adding the chain configuration:

    ```ts
    import { INSERT_REQUIRED_BUILDERS } from '@moonbeam-network/xcm-builder';
    import { INSERT_REQUIRED_ASSETS } from '../assets';
    import { INSERT_REQUIRED_CHAINS } from '../chains';
    import { AssetConfig } from '../types/AssetConfig';
    import { ChainConfig } from '../types/ChainConfig';

    // The chain config name should be formatted as: 'chainName' + 'Config'
    export const INSERT_CHAIN_CONFIG_NAME = new ChainConfig({
      assets: [], // In the next step, you'll add asset configs here
      chain: INSERT_CHAIN, // The source chain
    });
    ```

3. As seen in the above example, there is an `assets` array, which contains the chain's asset configurations. The asset configuration defines the asset being transferred, the destination chain, information associated with fees, and the builder functions. The builder functions must be used to build the queries or calls as if they were being executed from this chain.

    You'll need to create an Asset Config object for each asset, for example:

    ```ts
    new AssetConfig({
      asset: INSERT_ASSET,
      balance: INSERT_BALANCE_BUILDER,
      contract: INSERT_CONTRACT_BUILDER, // Optional
      destination: INSERT_DESTINATION_CHAIN,
      destinationFee: {
        amount: INSERT_FEE_BUILDER,
        asset: INSERT_ASSET,
        balance: INSERT_BALANCE_BUILDER,
      },
      extrinsic: INSERT_EXTRINSIC_BUILDER, // Optional
      fee: { // Optional
        asset: INSERT_ASSET,
        balance: INSERT_BALANCE_BUILDER,
        xcmDeliveryFeeAmount: INSERT_FEE_AMOUNT, // Optional
      },
      min: INSERT_MIN_ASSET_BUILDER, // Optional
    })
    ```

4. Add the newly created chain configurations to the `chainsConfigList` in the `xcm-sdk/blob/main/packages/config/src/configs/index.ts` file

!!! note
    Chain configurations are listed in alphabetical order. Please make sure you follow this order when adding new chain configurations.

For example, to add support to transfer USDT from the Polkadot Asset Hub to Moonbeam, the Polkadot Asset Hub configuration file is as follows:

```ts
import {
  AssetMinBuilder,
  BalanceBuilder,
  ExtrinsicBuilder,
  FeeBuilder,
} from '@moonbeam-network/xcm-builder';
import { usdt } from '../assets';
import { moonbeam, polkadotAssetHub } from '../chains';
import { AssetConfig } from '../types/AssetConfig';
import { ChainConfig } from '../types/ChainConfig';

const xcmDeliveryFeeAmount = 0.036;

export const polkadotAssetHubConfig = new ChainConfig({
  assets: [
    ...
    new AssetConfig({
      asset: usdt,
      balance: BalanceBuilder().substrate().assets().account(),
      destination: moonbeam,
      destinationFee: {
        amount: FeeBuilder().assetManager().assetTypeUnitsPerSecond(), 
        asset: usdt,
        balance: BalanceBuilder().substrate().assets().account(),
      },
      extrinsic: ExtrinsicBuilder()
        .polkadotXcm()
        .limitedReserveTransferAssets()
        .X2(),
      fee: {
        asset: dot,
        balance: BalanceBuilder().substrate().system().account(),
        xcmDeliveryFeeAmount,
      },
      min: AssetMinBuilder().assets().asset(),
    }),
  ],
  chain: polkadotAssetHub,
});
```

You're almost there. With this configuration, you'll be able to send the asset one-way from the configured chain to the asset's specified destination chain. To be able to send the asset back to the original source chain, you'll need to update (or create) the specified destination chain's configurations. Considering the above example, to transfer USDT from Moonbeam back to the Polkadot Asset Hub, the Moonbeam configuration file would need to be updated.

You'll need to take the exact same steps in the destination chain's configuration file. If a configuration file does not exist, you'll need to create one. Otherwise, update the chain's configuration file to include the asset configuration as outlined in step three.

For example, enabling USDT transfers from Moonbeam back to the Polkadot Asset Hub, requires the following Moonbeam chain configuration:

```ts
import { BalanceBuilder, ContractBuilder } from '@moonbeam-network/xcm-builder';
import {
  ...
  usdt,
} from '../assets';
import {
  ...
  polkadotAssetHub,
} from '../chains';
import { AssetConfig } from '../types/AssetConfig';
import { ChainConfig } from '../types/ChainConfig';

export const moonbeamConfig = new ChainConfig({
  assets: [
    ...
    new AssetConfig({
      asset: usdt,
      balance: BalanceBuilder().substrate().assets().account(),
      contract: ContractBuilder().Xtokens().transfer(),
      destination: polkadotAssetHub,
      destinationFee: {
        amount: 0.7,
        asset: usdt,
        balance: BalanceBuilder().substrate().assets().account(),
      },
      fee: {
        asset: glmr,
        balance: BalanceBuilder().substrate().system().account(),
      },
    }),
  ],
  chain: moonbeam,
});
```

And that's it! You now know how to add new assets and chains and configure the chains that an asset can be sent to and from. To ensure that you've properly set everything up, make sure to read on to the next section.

## Test New Configurations

The SDK is configured to work for the majority of the parachains in the Polkadot ecosystem. However, any given chain might have a different or particular way of requesting a specific piece of information, for example if it uses unconventional pallets or different methods for existing pallets.

To make sure that the new configurations have been properly set up, you can use the following queries.

- `assetRegistry.assetMetadatas` -  From here we extract the `decimals` and the `minBalance` for
`aSEED`:

    ```js
    {
      name: aUSD SEED
      symbol: aSEED
      decimals: 12
      minimalBalance: 100,0
    }
    ```

- `assets.metadata` - Here we get the `decimals` for `DOT`

    ```js
    {
    deposit: 0
    name: xcDOT
    symbol: xcDOT
    decimals: 10
    isFrozen: false
    }
    ```

- `balances.existentialDeposit` - This is the standard way of querying the existential deposit for most chains

    ```js
    100000000000
    ```

Most cases are considered already but for the chains being integrated, this data might be queried by a different pallet or function. You can check if the pallet is supported in the [Polkadot Service file](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/xcm-sdk/blob/main/packages/sdk/src/polkadot/PolkadotService.ts).
